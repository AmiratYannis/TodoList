# todo-list

This is a my website to create a to-do list. 
A task can be "To-do", "In progress" or "Finished".
Each user be able to create his own list of tasks. 


## Project setup


To install all of dependencies, you have enter this following command on terminal:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Before run front-end, you have to run back-end developped in Node JS on another terminal in folder back by using this following command: 

```
npm run dev
```

And then you can run the same command on folder front to run the full  ap of todo-list.  

### Test

To test API Rest of back-end developped in NodeJS, you have to run this following command in folder back to check if all tests of API Rest passed. 
I used Jest and Supertest to test API REST to check if the request GET, POST, PUT and DELETE work correctly.

```
npm test
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

To build project for production, you have to use the following command: 

```
npm run build
```
